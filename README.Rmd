# prompt

Dynamic Prompt. 

# Usage

This use `glue` to expand the function passed in, with the follwing bindings available: 

 - `t` the current time, in format "%H:%M:%S"
 - `v` the version of R
 - `V` the version of R, including the svn revision
 - `u` the user name
 - `g` the github user name
 - `m` the memory currently used by R
 - `w` the current working directory
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
set_prompt( ~ "{t}> " )
set_prompt( ~ "{w}> " )
set_prompt( ~ "[{m}] {t} {w}> ")
```

You can use `expand_prompt` to experiment : 

```{r}
expand_prompt( ~ "{t}> " )
expand_prompt( ~ "{w}> " )
expand_prompt( ~ "[{m}] {t} {w}> ")
```
 
## Installation

```
install_github( "ThinkR-open/prompt" )
```

## Initial ideas

in a way that can be configured. Things we might want to display: 

- current time
- memory used `pryr::mem_used`
- current working directory, maybe slightly differently when it's not the directory of the current rstudio project
- are we developping a package ? Do we need to rebuild it ? 
- are we sync with github
- R version
- ...
- (please add your own with PR)
